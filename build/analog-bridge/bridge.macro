; In this case, AB will execute the script "/dvswitch.sh" and pass the prarmeters of "mode DMR" to the script. 

DMR =   /dvswitch.sh mode DMR
DSTAR = /dvswitch.sh mode DSTAR
NXDN =  /dvswitch.sh mode NXDN
P25 =   /dvswitch.sh mode P25
YSF =   /dvswitch.sh mode YSF

; Ask AB to pull fresh data files and send to DVSM/UC
dbupdate = /dvswitch.sh collectProcessPushDataFiles
