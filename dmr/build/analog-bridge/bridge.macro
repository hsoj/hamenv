; bridge.macro
; This is a macro include file for Analog_Bridge(AB)
; The purpose of this file is to provide macro commands for use by DVSwitch Mobile(DVSM)
; These macros execute scripts when a DVSM user requests a mode change.


[MACROS]
; Example: When a DVSM user selects the DMR mode, AB will look for the mode below and execute the script and pass the parameter.
; In this case, AB will execute the script "/dvswitch.sh" and pass the prarmeters of "mode DMR" to the script. 

DMR =   /dvswitch.sh mode DMR
DSTAR = /dvswitch.sh mode DSTAR
NXDN =  /dvswitch.sh mode NXDN
P25 =   /dvswitch.sh mode P25
YSF =   /dvswitch.sh mode YSF

; Ask AB to pull fresh data files and send to DVSM/UC
dbupdate = /dvswitch.sh collectProcessPushDataFiles

; Example TG / Reflector Macro
9876 =  /parrot.sh
