# analog-bridge
The analog-bridge container provides a USRP service to communicate with the 
DVSwitch mobile application, as well as sends communications through the 
md380-emu container to encode/decode the DMR communications for the MMDVM 
bridge.

ANALOG_ADDR         # Address for this container
ANALOG_PORT         # Port for the Analog Bridge to RX from the MMDVM Bridge
CALLSIGN            # The operators callsign
DMR_ID              # DMR ID from radioid.net
EMULATOR_ADDR       # Address to the md380 emulator service
